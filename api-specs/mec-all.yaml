        First deletes all flows and then adds the default ones. In particular:
        * Default low priority rule for traffic originating from the LOCAL port of the switch, which is directed towards the Internet (or external networks)
        * Rules for communication (IP+ARP) between the local OVS host and the SGi
        * Rule for rewriting the dst MAC for packets coming from the UEs so that they reach the SGi (NAT box).

        the SPGW will notify the MEC platform that the UE is attached, they will be
        \npushed to the OVS. If the UE is already connected, however, the redirection

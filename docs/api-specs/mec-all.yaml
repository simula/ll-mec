        First deletes all flows and then adds the default ones. In particular:
        * Default low priority rule for traffic originating from the LOCAL port of the switch, which is directed towards the Internet (or external networks)
        * Rules for communication (IP+ARP) between the local OVS host and the SGi
        * Rule for rewriting the dst MAC for packets coming from the UEs so that they reach the SGi (NAT box).
